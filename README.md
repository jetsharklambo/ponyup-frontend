# 🎰 Pony Up - Judge Your Friends Like A True Degen

> *Because sometimes you need a neutral third party to tell your friends they fucking lost*

## 🚀 What The Fuck Is This?

Pony Up is a Web3 escrow platform for your IRL competitions. Instead of trusting your drunk friends to pay up after losing at poker, FIFA, or beer pong, you all put ETH into a smart contract first. When the game's over, winners get paid automatically. No bullshit, no "I'll Venmo you later," just cold hard crypto.

### 🔥 Features That Actually Matter

- **💰 Decentralized Escrow** - Smart contract holds the pot, not your sketchy friend
- **🧑‍⚖️ Judge System** - Neutral third party settles disputes (because your friends are liars)
- **🗳️ Democratic Voting** - No judge? Players vote on who won (good luck with that)
- **🏆 Multi-Winner Payouts** - 1st, 2nd, 3rd place splits like a real tournament
- **🔒 Game Locking** - Stop randos from joining your private degen sessions
- **📱 Mobile Ready** - Lose money from anywhere with a wallet
- **🎯 Game Codes** - Share "WTF-420" instead of contract addresses
- **⚡ Ultra-Fast Discovery** - Finds your games in 2-5 RPC calls (not 40+)
- **🔗 On-Chain Transparency** - Every decision recorded forever on blockchain

## 💰 How It Works (For Bigger Brains)

1. **Start a Game** 🎲
   - Set the buy-in (how much ETH you're risking today)
   - Pick max players (2-8 degenerates max)
   - Get your game code like "WTF-420"

2. **Add Your Degens & Set Rules** 👥
   - Share the code with your fellow gambling addicts  
   - Appoint a judge (someone you actually trust, good luck)
   - Set prize splits (70/30, 50/30/20, whatever floats your boat)
   - Lock that shit when you're ready

3. **Play & Report Like Adults** 🎯
   - Go play poker, chess, beer pong, whatever
   - Report winners in order (1st gets the most, obviously)
   - Judge decides OR everyone votes (democracy vs dictatorship)

4. **Get Your Money** 💵
   - Winners claim their exact share
   - Instant payouts to wallet
   - Go lose it all on something else
