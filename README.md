# 🎰 Pony Up V4 - Where Degens Settle Scores On-Chain

> *Because nothing says "I'm right" like putting your ETH where your mouth is*

## 🚀 What The Fuck Is This?

Pony Up is a Web3 gaming platform where you and your degen friends can bet on literally anything. Poker night? Chess match? Who can chug a beer faster? Doesn't matter - if there's a dispute about who won, settle it with ETH like civilized apes.

### 🎮 The Vibe

- **No KYC bullshit** - Connect wallet, start playing
- **No centralized fuckery** - Smart contracts handle the money
- **No waiting for payouts** - Winner takes all, instantly
- **Built on Sepolia** - Because we're not complete psychopaths (testnet for now)

## 💰 How It Works (For Smooth Brains)

1. **Start a Game** 🎲
   - Set the buy-in (how much ETH you're willing to lose)
   - Get a game code like "APE-420"
   - Share with your fellow degens

2. **Everyone Joins** 🦍
   - Enter the game code
   - Pay the buy-in
   - Wait for everyone to join (or don't, YOLO)

3. **Play Your Game** 🎯
   - Go play poker, chess, beer pong, whatever
   - This platform doesn't give a shit what you're playing
   - Just need to agree on who won

4. **Report Winners** 🏆
   - Everyone votes on who won
   - Smart contract holds the funds until consensus
   - No consensus? Funds stay locked forever (don't be that guy)

5. **Get Paid** 💵
   - Winner claims the pot
   - Instant payout to your wallet
   - Go lose it on something else
